This is my first game development project called HolyWar. 

CopyRight 2018, Anthony Logan Mitchell, All rights reserved.
Holy war is my personal programming project and all artwork
and high level programming outside of SDL2 framework, openGL,
and c++ POSIX api standard are my original work in progress.


TODO List:
#1 bug will crash game if I try moving the cursor during the transion from the level selection to the actual  match gameplay.
#2 Start working on collision systems with combat.
#3 Implement Smash attacks on each character attack.


id also like to work on a system that would allow me to click and hold the attack button and it would take whatever animation you are on and do a smash attack with it.
